## üß† How Redis Caching Works

On first load, the app fetches product data from the API and stores it in Redis for **120 seconds**. During that period, any new request will be served directly from the Redis cache, significantly speeding up the response and reducing the number of API calls.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Caching

- Faster response times for repeated requests  
- Reduced load on the external API  
- Better scalability for future growth
